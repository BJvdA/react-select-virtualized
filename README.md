\***\* UNSTABLE VERSION - NOT YET FINISHED \*\*** SOON TO BE RELEASED \*\*\*\*

> react-select v2 + react-virtualized + react hooks!

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-select-virtualized.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select-virtualized) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This project came up after hours of trying to find an autocomplete component that supports large sets of data to be displayed and searched for while maintain performance. The only libraries out there that allow this functionality are either not maintained anymore, use outdated libraries or are poorly performant.
I created a component that uses the Airbnb library called `react-virtualized` for the virtual data loading of elements and plugged it to the `react-select` (the most used autocomplete library for react) menu list.

only takes 15kb!

## Note

The select component will be the same from `react-select v2` so you will be able to use it with any select you already have.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-select-virtualized
```

### Peer Dependencies

remember to install them also if they are not already in your project.

NOTE: "react-hover-observer" is temporary until I implement it myself.

```bash
{
    "prop-types": "^15.5.4",
    "react": "^16.8.3",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.3",
    "react-hover-observer": "^2.1.1",
    "react-select": "2.2.0",
    "react-virtualized": "^9.21.0",
    "classnames": "^2.2.6"
  }
```

## Storybook

Do you want to see it working? -> https://serene-hawking-021d7a.netlify.com/

## Roadmap

- useCallback every where. DONE
- move fast options to group. DONE
- fix minimum input search on grouped component. DONE
- upgrade alpha version. DONE
- review all the TODOs. DONE
- improve filtering function in fasr-react-select
- review support to all the react-select props. Should all work but multi-val.

  <----- FIRST RELEASE ---->
I have decided to work in the filter on the infinite loader after the release. I tried but the results where not the expected one i wanted.
  <-------------------------->

- filtering data on infinite loader, performance degradation start after 30000 elements we need to filter only first batch size so we don't see any
- add multi value support
- add testing so we do not only relay on storybook
- remove react-hover-observer and do it ourselves so we do not have one more peer dep. Leave this till the end.

## React-select Issues

- cacheOptions do not work with async select and grouped options. we will need to relay on filtering on infinite loader.
